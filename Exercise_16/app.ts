//storing guests name in an arry
let guest_list: string[] = ["Bilal", "Ahmed", "Shahmir" , "Abdul Rehman"];

//printing personalized invitation to each person seperately
console.log(`Hello ${guest_list[0]}, you are invited to dinner tonight.`);

console.log(`Hello ${guest_list[2]}, you are invited to dinner tonight.`);
console.log(`Hello ${guest_list[3]}, you are invited to dinner tonight.`);

//printing guest cant make to the dinner
