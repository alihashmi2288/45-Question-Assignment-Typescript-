Exercise 17:

Shrinking Guest List: You just found out that your new dinner table won’t arrive in time for the dinner, and you have space for only two guests.

 • Start with your program from Exercise 16. Add a new line that prints a message saying that you can invite only two people for dinner.

 • Remove guests from your list one at a time until only two names remain in your list. Each time you pop a name from your list, print a message to that person letting them know you’re sorry you can’t invite them to dinner.
