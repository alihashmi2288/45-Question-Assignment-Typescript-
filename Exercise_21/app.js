// Exercise 21:
// They think of something you could store in a TypeScript Object. Write a program that creates Objects containing these items.

"use strict";
let myObject = {
    name: "Syed Ali Hashmi",
    age: 19,
    city: "Karachi",
    country: "Pakistan"
};
//printing object
console.log(myObject);
//printing an item from object
console.log(myObject.name);
